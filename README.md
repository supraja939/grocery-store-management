Grocery Store Management System is a full-stack web application developed using Flask, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to manage products, orders, and customer billing in a grocery store. The system includes a secure login page, a product management module where products can be added, reactivated, or marked inactive instead of being deleted to protect order history, and an order management module that allows users to select products from the database, automatically fetch prices, calculate totals based on quantity, and generate a final bill. All orders are saved into the database with full details including customer name, date, order total, and item-wise breakdown. The project uses REST APIs for communication between frontend and backend and follows professional database practices using foreign keys and soft deletes to ensure data safety. This application demonstrates real-world billing, inventory handling, and order processing.
